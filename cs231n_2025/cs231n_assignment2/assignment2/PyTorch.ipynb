        "A PyTorch Tensor is conceptionally similar to a numpy array: it is an n-dimensional grid of numbers, and like numpy PyTorch provides many functions to efficiently operate on Tensors. As a simple example, we provide a `flatten` function below which reshapes image data for use in a fully-connected neural network.\n",

        "This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).\n",

        "Barebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`.\n",

        "\n",
        "3.在`forward（）`方法中，定义网络的*连通性*。您应该使用`__init__`中定义的属性作为函数调用，将张量作为输入并输出“转换”后的张量。不要在`forward（）`中创建任何具有可学习参数的新层！所有这些都必须在`__init__`中预先声明。\n",

        "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",

        "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
        "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
        "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
        "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Going above and beyond\n",
        "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
        "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
        "- Model ensembles\n",
        "- Data augmentation\n",
        "- New Architectures\n",
        "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
